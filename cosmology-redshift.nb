(*Step by step to calculating the age of the universe*)

(*Hubble's law is an experimental result which states that galaxies are receding from one another at v=H0 D, which would imply the age of the universe to be: t=D/v=1/H0 = 14.4 Gyrs. Hubble's constant however is not static and evolves with time depending on the composition of the universe.

(*Friedmann's equation gives us a way to find the "real" evolving Hubble parameter as a function of the density parameters*)

H^2 = H0^2(Om a^(-3)+Ol)
(D[a,t])^2/a^2 = H0^2(Om a^(-3)+Ol)
(D[a,t])^2=H0^2(Om a^(-1)+Ol a^(2))
da/dt = H0*Sqrt[Om/a + Ol a^(2)]
da/Sqrt[Om/a + Ol a^(2)] = H0 dt
da/(Sqrt[Ol]Sqrt[Om/(Ol a) + a^(2)]) = H0 dt

(*The equations are just illustrative, if the typesetting is confusing check out the image at: https://imgur.com/a/0K5392m *)
(*The problem is reduced to calculating t = (I/(sqrt(Ol)))*1/H0 *)
(*Where I is the integral:*)
I = Integrate[1/Sqrt[L/a+a^2], {a,0,1}]
(*and L is the ratio between matter and radiation density*)
(*taking the experimental values below for a flat universe Om+Ol =1, we can evaluate the integral numerically*)

Om = 0.26
Ol = 0.74
L = Om/Ol
In = NIntegrate[1/Sqrt[L/a+a^2], {a,0,1},Method->{"RiemannRule","Type"->"Right"},MaxPoints->100]
(*NIntegrate gives a fine result, but we can get a better result by manually implementing the right endpoint rule*)

Sum[1/(0.35/a + a^2), {a, 1/100, 1, 1/100}]/100
(*finally t = 0.79/0.86 * 14.4Gyrs =13.2 Gyrs *) 
1/H0=14.4
t = In/Sqrt[Ol] * 1/H0
